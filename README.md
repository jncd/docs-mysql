## Which branch to use?

**Note**: Provide instructions in your PRs to indicate which branches you want Docs to apply your commits to. 

| Branch name | Use for… |
|-------------| ------|
| master      | NOT IN USE|
| 2.3         | "edge" build | 
| 2.2         | v2.2.x | 
| 2.1         | v2.1.x | 
| 2.0         | v2.0.x |
| 1.11        | There are no plans for a v1.11. However, because it publishes to the edge branch, you could use it to stage big changes for the v1.10.x without worrying they'll go to production prematurely. |
| 1.10        | v1.10.x |
| 1.9         | v1.9.x |

**Note**: Branches 1.8 through 1.4 are no longer published as live documentation. However, documentation for those versions of PDFs is available as PDFs.
